# Welcome to Games Guides (Name subject to change)

I was getting tired of searching online for guides to specific games I play. I decided that I wanted to build my own website with all of the guides on one page we can access. This is a work in progress and a lot of the UI is subject to change.

For now the user can choose which game they want to see the guides on and the page will render with the specific guides the user wants.

This allows the user to see all of the important guides all in one page and organized in a way where its easy for the user to search for what they want.
